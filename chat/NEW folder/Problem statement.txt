A kanban board is a project management tool designed to help visualize work, manage project tasks, workflows and communication.
 
In this challenge, you are going to write the unit test cases for the given Kanban board Flask application using Pytest and 
deploy the application using Docker Compose.

Instructions:

1. Write the unit test cases using Pytest testing framework in the following path '~/Desktop/Project/wingst5-may2023-s1h1/test.py'
2. Refer 'test.py' file for further instructions.
3. Commands to Execute:
    - 'export FLASK_APP=app.py' to set an environment variable.
    - 'python3 -m flask run' to run the Flask application.
    - 'python3 -m pytest test.py' to run the test cases.
4. Once you done with test cases. Deploy the Kanbanboard Flask application in Docker using Docker Compose.
5. Create a 'Dockerfile' to dockerize the Kanbanboard Flask application with 'python alpine3.7' as its base image named 'kanbanboard_app_image'.
6. Create 'docker-compose.yml' file to create a service named 'app' with the docker image (kanbanboard_app_image), container named 'kanbanboard_app_container', connect a bridge network named 'app_network', attach a volume named 'app_volume' and deploy the application in 5005 port.
7. Visit "http://localhost:5005/" URL in the browser and ensure that the application is running successful.
