I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that the issue persists even after upgrading `pip`. The error is related to the `zope.interface` package. 

One possible solution is to modify the `requirements.txt` file to specify a version of `zope.interface` that is compatible with the `setuptools` version installed in the Alpine image. You can try changing the `zope.interface` line in `requirements.txt` to `zope.interface==5.4.0` (or any other version that is known to work with your setup).

After making this change, update your Dockerfile as follows:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN apk update && \
    apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```

Please update the `requirements.txt` file and the Dockerfile with the changes, and try building the Docker image again. Let me know if you encounter any further issues.
