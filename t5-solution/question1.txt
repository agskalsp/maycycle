1. Create a Docker network named "my_external_network" and a volume named "my_external_volume".

2. Create a "docker-compose.yml file in the path "~/Desktop/Project/kickoffs-docker-compose-containerizing-bookstack" which creates two services named "bookstack" and "bookstack_db".

3. The "bookstack" service should run the "ghcr.io/linuxserver/bookstack" image as a container named "bookstack_container". Configure the "bookstack" service to be dependent on the service "bookstack_db". Expose the "bookstack service to port 8885, connect it to the network "my_external_network" and set the environment variables as follows.

APP URL http://localhost:8085
DB_HOST> bookstack_db
DB USER> bookstack user
DB PASS -> MySecurePassword
DB_DATABASE -> bookstack

4. The "bookstack_db" service should run the "mysql" image as a container named "bookstack_db_container". Mount it to "my_external_volume" with source -/Desktop/Project/kickoffs-docker-compose-containerizing-bookstack/my external volume and target "/var/lib/mysql", connect it to the network "my external network" and set the environment variables as follows.

MYSQL ROOT PASSWORD-> MySecureRoot Password 
MYSQL DATABASE-> bookstack
MYSQL USER > bookstack user
MYSQL_PASSWORD-> MySecurePassword

5. Run the docker-compose file, once both the services are running, hit the port of "bookstack" service and login to Bookstack with email Id "admin@admin.com" and password "password".

6. Create a new book in Bookstack with title "Containerizing Bookstack" and give the description as "You have successfully containerized bookstack"

7. Finally, Export the book as a contained webfile.
