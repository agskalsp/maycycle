FINGERPRINTING IN JENKINS
------------------------------------------------
The artifacts are fingerprinted to yes when copying so that a MD5 checksum is created.
It can then be used across any job using that MD5 checksum .
When an artifact is created or used, Jenkins generates an MD5 checksum using the artifact. 
This checksum and the job where it was created are tracked in an internal database. 
This becomes the fileâ€™s fingerprint. 
Jenkins can then use the fingerprint to determine what jobs either created or accessed a file.


If a job needs to access an artifact created in another job, 
the Copy Artifact Plugin can be used. 
This plugin provides a build step for pulling artifacts from one job into another. 
When you use the copy artifacts build step, security comes into play. 
The job that creates the artifact must include an option that gives another job permission to copy the artifact.
